Lesson 4: extracting (subject, relation, object) triples from a document
by prompting Gemini.

then run it with:

    prompt = f"""You are extracting relationships for a knowledge graph.

Read the text below and list EVERY relationship between two entities as
a (subject, relation, object) triple, including actions one entity took
regarding another (e.g. "flagged as drifting", "noticed", "pulled",
"recalibrated"), not just static facts. Be thorough: aim for at least
one triple per sentence that mentions two or more entities.

When a sentence describes an action about something already named
earlier in the text, use that thing's established full name as the
subject or object, not a pronoun, a paraphrase, or an abstract noun
like "drift" or "the issue." For example, if "the humidity sensor" was
already introduced, "Dev flagged it as drifting" should produce
("Dev", "flagged as drifting", "humidity sensor"), not
("Dev", "flagged", "drift").

The subject and object should be short entity names (people, places,
specific things), and the relation should be a short verb phrase
(2-4 words).

Return ONLY a JSON array of 3-element arrays, like:
[["Mia", "recalibrated", "humidity sensor"], ["multimeter", "kept in", "garage bench"]]
